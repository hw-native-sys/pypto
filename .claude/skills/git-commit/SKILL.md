# PyPTO Git Commit Workflow

## Prerequisites

⚠️ **ALWAYS run these agents first (IN PARALLEL):**
1. **`code-reviewer`** - Review code quality
2. **`testing`** - Verify build and tests pass

**Launch both simultaneously to save time.**

## Workflow

1. Launch code-review and testing agents in parallel
2. Wait for both to complete
3. Address any issues found
4. Stage changes
5. Generate commit message
6. Commit and verify

## Stage Changes

**Related changes together**:
```bash
git add path/to/file1.cpp path/to/file2.h
git diff --staged  # Review
```

**Cross-layer pattern** (C++ + Python + Type stubs + Tests):
```bash
git add include/pypto/ir/expr.h python/bindings/ir_binding.cpp \
        python/pypto/pypto_core/__init__.pyi tests/ut/ir/test_expr.py
```

**Never stage**: Build artifacts (`build/`, `*.o`), temp files, IDE configs

## Commit Message Format

**Structure**: `type(scope): description (≤72 chars)`

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, style, chore, perf
**Scope**: Module/component (ir, printer, builder)
**Description**: Present tense, action verb, no period

**Good examples**:
```
feat(ir): Add unique identifier field to MemRef
fix(printer): Update printer to use yield_ instead of yield
refactor(builder): Simplify tensor construction logic
test(ir): Add edge case coverage for structural comparison
```

**Bad examples** (avoid):
```
❌ feat(ir): Added feature.  # Past tense, has period
❌ Fix bug                   # Missing type prefix
❌ WIP                       # Not descriptive
```

## Commit

```bash
# Short message
git commit -m "feat(ir): Add tensor rank validation"

# Detailed message (in editor)
git commit
```

**In editor**:
```
feat(ir): Add tensor rank validation

Validates tensor rank is positive before setting shape.
Raises ValueError for invalid ranks.
Updates tests with edge case coverage.
```

## Co-Author Policy

**❌ NEVER add AI assistants**: No Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, etc.
**✅ Only credit human contributors**: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`

**Why?** AI tools are not collaborators. Commits reflect human authorship.

## Post-Commit Verification

```bash
git show HEAD              # View commit
git log -1                 # Check message
git show HEAD --name-only  # Verify files
```

**Fix issues** (only if not pushed):
```bash
git commit --amend -m "Corrected message"      # Fix message
git add file && git commit --amend --no-edit   # Add forgotten file
```

⚠️ **Only amend unpushed commits!**

## Checklist
