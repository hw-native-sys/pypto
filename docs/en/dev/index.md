# Developer Documentation

How PyPTO is built: the IR, the pass pipeline, code generation, and the
infrastructure around them.

This is documentation for people working *on* the compiler. If you are writing
PyPTO programs, start with the [User Manual](../user/index.md).

## Sub-chapters

| Chapter | What it covers |
| ------- | -------------- |
| [IR](ir/index.md) | Node hierarchy, type system, operators, builder, parser, serialization, structural comparison |
| [Passes](passes/index.md) | The pass framework and every pass in the default pipeline, numbered in execution order |
| [Language](language/index.md) | The Python DSL syntax specification and external C++ kernel integration |
| [Code Generation](codegen/index.md) | Lowering IR to PTO-ISA dialect MLIR and to orchestration C++ |
| [Backend](backend/index.md) | Per-architecture dispatch through `BackendHandler` |
| [Debug](debug/index.md) | Lowering IR to an executable PyTorch script for numerical validation |

## Top-level topics

| Page | What it covers |
| ---- | -------------- |
| [PTO Project Ecosystem](00-ecosystem.md) | The multi-repo toolchain — PyPTO, PTOAS, pto-isa, simpler, pypto-lib — and how they fit together |
| [Compile Profiling](01-compile-profiling.md) | Built-in wall-clock timing of the compilation pipeline |
| [Error Handling](02-error-handling.md) | `CHECK` vs `INTERNAL_CHECK`, PyPTO exception types, IR source locations in failures |
| [Logging](03-logging.md) | The two independent logging subsystems and which one a message came from |
| [Runtime DFX Flags](03-runtime-dfx.md) | The five runtime diagnostic sub-features exposed through `RunConfig` |
| [Replaying an Existing `build_output`](03-runtime-replay.md) | Re-run, edit, and re-measure a compiled build directory without recompiling |
| [Simulator Trace Cleaning](04-simulator-trace-cleaning.md) | Converting MindStudio Insight binary dumps into readable traces |
| [Per-Task Ring Sizing](05-runtime-ring-sizing.md) | The three ring-size overrides on `RunConfig` and when to tune them |
| [Persistent L3 execution](06-persistent-l3.md) | Reusing one worker across prepared distributed programs |
| [Memory Map](07-memory-map.md) | Rendering a pass dump into an interactive HTML map of on-chip memory |
| [Distributed Operators](distributed_ops.md) | The N6 distributed op family — typed DSL access to collectives and primitives |
| [PTOAS Op Status Matrix](ptoas-op-status.md) | Which public and compatibility PTOAS ops the compiler currently emits |
